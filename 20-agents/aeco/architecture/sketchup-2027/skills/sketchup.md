# Sketchup

Auto-generated from vendor docs for sketchup 2027.0. 99 types in this namespace.

## Animation (class)

This class is abstract. Implement the methods described in this class to create a an animation. You can not sub-class this class because it is not defined by the API. The Animation interface is implemented to create animations inside SketchUp. At any given time, a single animation can be active on a View. To make your own, build a Ruby class that contains the methods described below: Animation objects are activated by using the View#animation= method on a View object. To stop an animation set the view’s animation object to nil, like so: Managing Multiple Animations: While only one animation object can be active on a View at any given time, you can create a composite animation class to manage multiple animations simultaneously. This approach allows you to animate different elements, such as objects and the camera, within a single animation framework. Example: Combining Animations

[Vendor docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/Animation.html)

### Methods
#### `nextFrame(view) => Boolean`

The #nextFrame method is invoked by SketchUp to tell the animation to display its next frame.

**Remarks:** The #nextFrame method is invoked by SketchUp to tell the animation to display its next frame. This method should set up the camera and then call View#show_frame. The #nextFrame method is the only required method of the Sketchup::Animation interface that you must implement.

**Parameters:**
- `view` (Sketchup::View) — The view for the animation.

**Returns:** `Boolean` — continue - true if you want the animation to continue on to the next frame, false if you want the animation to stop after this frame.

[Docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/Animation.html#nextFrame-instance_method)

#### `pause => nil`

Note: The user interface for pausing and resuming animations isn’t integrated with the Ruby API in the current version, so this method is probably not useful to you.

**Remarks:** Note: The user interface for pausing and resuming animations isn’t integrated with the Ruby API in the current version, so this method is probably not useful to you. The #pause method is invoked by SketchUp when the animation is paused. This method is optional (you do not need to implement this method unless you want to perform some specialized function when the animation is paused). You cannot call this method in your code explicitly and expect an animation to pause, only certain SketchUp events cause the method to be called.

**Returns:** `nil` — 

[Docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/Animation.html#pause-instance_method)

#### `resume => nil`

Note: The user interface for pausing and resuming animations isn’t integrated with the Ruby API in the current version, so this method is probably not useful to you.

**Remarks:** Note: The user interface for pausing and resuming animations isn’t integrated with the Ruby API in the current version, so this method is probably not useful to you. The #resume method is invoked by SketchUp when the animation is resumed after being paused. This method is optional (you do not need to implement this method unless you want to perform some specialized function when the animation is resumed). You cannot call this method in your code explicitly and expect an animation to stop, only certain SketchUp events cause the method to be called.

**Returns:** `nil` — 

[Docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/Animation.html#resume-instance_method)

#### `stop => nil`

Note: Do not call View#animation= from this method.

**Remarks:** Note: Do not call View#animation= from this method. This will cause a recursive loop and crash SketchUp 2017 and earlier versions. As of SketchUp 2018 this will raise a RunTimeError. The #stop method is invoked by SketchUp when the animation is stopped. This method is optional (you do not need to implement this method unless you want to perform some specialized function when the animation is stopped). You cannot call this method in your code explicitly and expect an animation to stop, only certain SketchUp events cause the method to be called. Perhaps the most common way for this method to be called is when your Ruby code sets View#animation= to nil. See the class comments for an example of this.

**Returns:** `nil` — 

[Docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/Animation.html#stop-instance_method)

## AppObserver (class)

This class is abstract. To implement this observer, create a Ruby class of this type, override the desired methods, and add an instance of the observer to the application class. This observer interface is implemented to react to application events. This interface is often used to attach other observers to models as they are opened or started. This ensures that your observers are watching all open models. For example, when one attaches a SelectionObserver, it is only attached to the Selection collection of a given model. If a 2nd model is opened, the new model’s selection changes will not fire selection callbacks unless you’ve attached a SelectionObserver to the new model as well. By watching for #onNewModel, you can be sure to do so.

[Vendor docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/AppObserver.html)

### Methods
#### `expectsStartupModelNotifications => Boolean`

Note: Prior to SketchUp 2014, #onNewModel and #onOpenModel were not being called for the startup models.

**Remarks:** Note: Prior to SketchUp 2014, #onNewModel and #onOpenModel were not being called for the startup models. This issue is now fixed but observers still need to express their intent to receive these calls. This is for back-compatibility with existing scripts which worked around these missing calls by other means. For new code, this method should be implemented and should return true. The #expectsStartupModelNotifications method is called to determine if the observer expects to receive #onNewModel and #onOpenModel calls for the models that are created or opened at SketchUp startup. This includes the empty initial model, a model opened via command line arguments, or auto-restored models on Mac OS X.

**Returns:** `Boolean` — true to receive #onNewModel and #onOpenModel calls for startup models. Return false or simply not implement the method in order to not receive these calls (which was the behavior prior to SketchUp 2014).

[Docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/AppObserver.html#expectsStartupModelNotifications-instance_method)

#### `onOpenModel(model) => nil`

Note: If a skp file is loaded via the command line or double-clicking on a skp in explorer (which is also is the command line) then this observer will not be called.

**Remarks:** Note: If a skp file is loaded via the command line or double-clicking on a skp in explorer (which is also is the command line) then this observer will not be called. The Ruby interpreter in SketchUp is initialized after command line processing so the observer won’t be added in time to get the notification. The #onOpenModel method is called when the application opens an existing model.

**Parameters:**
- `model` (Sketchup::Model) — The active model object.

**Returns:** `nil` — 

[Docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/AppObserver.html#onOpenModel-instance_method)

#### `onQuit => nil`

The #onQuit method is called when SketchUp closes.

**Remarks:** The #onQuit method is called when SketchUp closes. This is useful if you need to clean up anything or store your application state upon close.

**Returns:** `nil` — 

[Docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/AppObserver.html#onQuit-instance_method)

#### `onUnloadExtension(extension_name) => nil`

The #onUnloadExtension method is called when the user turns off a Ruby extension.

**Remarks:** The #onUnloadExtension method is called when the user turns off a Ruby extension. This is useful for detecting if the user is deactivating some critical set of observers, for example, so you can warn them or cache your extension state.

**Returns:** `nil` — 

[Docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/AppObserver.html#onUnloadExtension-instance_method)

## ArcCurve (class)

An ArcCurve is a Curve that makes up part of a circle. This is the underlying class for circles as well. You can think of ArcCurves as entities that were created with SketchUp’s Arc or Circle drawing tools and Curves as entities that were created with the Freehand drawing tool. However, keep in mind that all Curves in SketchUp are really edges with some extra data attached to them. When you use the API to draw a Curve or ArcCurve, you are really drawing edges. ArcCurve is a subclass of Curve, so all of the methods that are available to Curves are also available to ArcCurves.

## ComponentDefinition (class)

The ComponentDefinition class is used to define the contents for a SketchUp component. Components are a collection of entities that can be instanced and reused multiple times throughout a model. For example, you could draw a chair once, turn it into a component, and then use 6 instances of it to surround a table. Edits to the original “definition” will then propagate across all of its instances. The ComponentDefinition class contains the global entities and settings for each definition. See the ComponentInstance class for how each copy is defined. Starting from SketchUp 2018+, the ComponentDefinition class contains a new default attribute dictionary named “SU_DefinitionSet” with default keys named named “Price”, “Size”, “Url”. See the Help article for more information. The dictionary cannot be deleted via ruby and an ArgumentError will be raised. The key/value pairs in the dictionary can be deleted safely.

Note: The Intersection group can be empty (contain no geometry) when volumes only touch or one lies entirely within the other without producing new partitioning geometry. Note: Undo will restore pre‑split objects but object references you held beforehand become stale; reacquire them if needed. Note: Not available in SketchUp Make. The #split method performs a boolean “split” (map overlay) between this component instance (the receiver) and another manifold solid (group or component instance). The operation partitions the combined volumes into: Difference2: (other - self) Difference1: (self - other) Intersection: (self ∩ other) The originals (self and other) are ERASED and replaced by three newly created groups representing these volumes.

#### `build {|builder| ... } => nil`

Note: While using #build it is important to not add or remove vertices by other means than the builder.

**Remarks:** Note: While using #build it is important to not add or remove vertices by other means than the builder.

Creates an Sketchup::EntitiesBuilder that can be used to generate bulk geometry with performance in mind. This is particularly useful for importers where the geometry is already well defined and one wants to recreate it without further processing. The call to #build starts an implicit operation, even if no other model changes are made within the block. This is not the same as Model#start_operation, so it’s still recommended to wrap all model changes, including #build with Model#start_operation and Model#commit_operation. Refer to the documentation of Sketchup::EntitiesBuilder for more details.

#### `fill_from_mesh(polygon_mesh, weld_vertices = true, smooth_flags = Geom::PolygonMesh::AUTO_SOFTEN|Geom::PolygonMesh::SMOOTH_SOFT_EDGES, f_material = nil, b_material = nil) => Boolean`

The #fill_from_mesh method is used to add faces and edges to the collection of entities from a Geom::PolygonMesh.

**Remarks:** The #fill_from_mesh method is used to add faces and edges to the collection of entities from a Geom::PolygonMesh. It requires that the entities collection to be filled is empty. It has higher performance than #add_faces_from_mesh, but does less error checking as it builds the geometry. The smooth_flags parameter can contain any of the following values if passed. The constants were added in SketchUp 2014. For previous versions, numeric values have to be specified instead of the Ruby constants: 0: Geom::PolygonMesh::NO_SMOOTH_OR_HIDE 1: Geom::PolygonMesh::HIDE_BASED_ON_INDEX (Negative point index will hide the edge.) 2: Geom::PolygonMesh::SOFTEN_BASED_ON_INDEX (Negative point index will soften the edge.) 4: Geom::PolygonMesh::AUTO_SOFTEN (Interior edges are softened.) 8: Geom::PolygonMesh::SMOOTH_SOFT_EDGES (All soft edges will also be smooth.) The 4rd and 5th parameters will accept a Material object or a string name of a material currently in the model.

**Parameters:**
- `polygon_mesh` (Geom::PolygonMesh)
- `weld_vertices` (Boolean) — This argument has no effect and is kept for compatibility reasons. Points are always merged.
- `smooth_flags` (Integer) — flags for softening and smoothing of edges.
- `f_material` (Sketchup::Material, String) — material to paint front faces with.
- `b_material` (Sketchup::Material, String) — material to paint back faces with.

**Returns:** `Boolean` —

#### `intersect_with(recurse, transform1, entities1, transform2, hidden, entities2) => Array<Sketchup::Edge>`

The #intersect_with method computes the intersections between two sets of entities in different 3D contexts and creates the resulting intersection edges in a third context.

**Remarks:** The #intersect_with method computes the intersections between two sets of entities in different 3D contexts and creates the resulting intersection edges in a third context. This powerful method operates on three distinct sets of entities: The Receiver (self): The Sketchup::Entities collection the method is called on. The Cutting Entities (entities2): The entities that intersect with the receiver. The Result Container (entities1): The Sketchup::Entities collection where the new intersection edges are placed. The transformations transform1 and transform2 are used to relate these three different contexts to each other, allowing for intersections to be calculated between objects anywhere in the model hierarchy. The intersection calculation occurs in a common coordinate space, and the transformations are used to bring the geometry into that space.

**Parameters:**
- `recurse` (Boolean) — If ‘true`, the intersection will recurse through any nested Groups or Components within the receiver (`self`).
- `transform1` (Geom::Transformation) — The transformation applied to the receiver entities (‘self`) to position them in the common coordinate space where the intersection will be calculated.
- `entities1` (Sketchup::Entities) — The result entities collection. This is the drawing context where the new intersection edges will be created.
- `transform2` (Geom::Transformation) — The transformation applied to the result entities collection (‘entities1`) to correctly position it relative to the intersection calculation space.
- `hidden` (Boolean) — If true, hidden geometry in the receiver entities will be considered for the intersection. This parameter only affects hidden geometry in the receiver, not in the cutting entities.
- `entities2` (Sketchup::Entity, Array<Sketchup::Entity>) — The cutting entities. These are the entities that will be intersected with the receiver. This can be a single entity or an array of entities.

**Returns:** `Array<Sketchup::Edge>` — The intersecting edges created. This array may be empty if no intersection(s) were found.

## EntitiesBuilder (class)

Note: Like Geom::PolygonMesh there is minimal validation checks made on the input to the creation of the geometry. Vertices are de-duplicated and edges sharing the same vertices will be de-duplicated. But no intersection of overlapping entities is made. It leaves a higher responsibility on the API user to produce valid geometry. Note: While using Sketchup::Entities#build it is important to not add or remove vertices by other means of the builder. Also don’t modify the position of the vertices in the Entities container geometry is added to. Doing so can break the vertex-cache that de-duplicates the vertices. The EntitiesBuilder is an interface to generate bulk geometry with performance in mind. This is particularly useful for importers where the geometry is already well defined and one wants to recreate it without further processing. Before the Entities Builder was introduced there were two ways of adding geometry; the add_* methods of Entities and Geom::PolygonMesh. The former is slow as the methods perform intersection, splitting and merging of overlapping geometry. This is useful when creating tools similar to the Line and Rectangle tool. Geom::PolygonMesh is fast, but it doesn’t provide granular control per face or edge added. Entities Builder is similar to Geom::PolygonMesh in speed, but with the flexibility of Entities‘s add_* methods. (See “Creating a triangulated grid” example)

## FrameChangeObserver (class)

This class is abstract. Implement the methods described in this class to create a frame change observer. You can not sub-class this class because it is not defined by the API. This observer interface is implemented to react to changes in camera position (a frame) between one scene page and another. This observer’s callback method is called when the user manually makes a scene change, or the internal animation feature runs. This abstract observer is any object that implements a callback method frameChange with 3 arguments: from_scene (the scene that you transition from), to_scene (the scene that you transition toward) and a percent_done between 0.0 and 1.0 (that indicates the percentage of transition between the two scenes.) The observer is attached using the Pages.add_frame_change_observer class method, which returns an integer id that can be stored and later used to detach the observer. Later, detaching this observer is done by passing this id reference to the Pages.remove_frame_change_observer class method.

[Vendor docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/FrameChangeObserver.html)

### Methods
#### `frameChange(from_scene, to_scene, percent_done) => Object`

Note: The from_scene argument into this callback does not appear to be populated on the PC.

**Remarks:** Note: The from_scene argument into this callback does not appear to be populated on the PC. You can store a variable that keeps track of the to_scene and then use that on a subsequent Scene selection to determine the last Page that the user was on. This callback method is called during a slide show or creation of an animation after the camera has been set up, but before the frame is displayed. It gives you a chance to perform your own actions during the animation. The arguments for frameChange method are the scene page that you transition from (from_scene), the scene page that you transition to (to_scene), and a percent_done between 0.0 and 1.0 that tell you the percentage of the transition between the two scene pages. By watching for percent_done >= 1.0, you can activate Ruby code that executes as soon as the user’s camera has finished animating.

**Parameters:**
- `from_scene` (Sketchup::Page, nil) — The previous scene page the view is transitioning from.
- `to_scene` (Sketchup::Page) — The selected scene page the view is transitioning towards.
- `percent_done` (Float) — The percentage of transition between the two scene pages.

[Docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/FrameChangeObserver.html#frameChange-instance_method)

## Group (class)

A Group class contains methods for manipulating groups of entities. Groups in SketchUp are very similar to components, but can from a user point of view be thought of as unique objects. Groups can be instanced when copied but are silently made unique when edited through the GUI. To honor this behavior, make sure to call #make_unique before modifying a group through the API.

## Importer (class)

The Importer interface lets you build your own importers for SketchUp. To use this, you create a subclass of Importer and implement all of the methods described below. This will make your importer appear in the list that users see under File > Import, and you can use Ruby to do all of the work of opening the file and creating whatever you need inside SketchUp. Here is an example of a complete script that imports a .txt file and displays its contents in a messagebox.

[Vendor docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/Importer.html)

### Methods
#### `description => Object`

This method is called by SketchUp to determine the description that appears in the File > Import dialog’s pulldown list of valid importers.

**Remarks:** This method is called by SketchUp to determine the description that appears in the File > Import dialog’s pulldown list of valid importers. Though it is common for the description to include the file extension supported by the importer (such as “Text Importer (.txt)”), the actual extension is defined in the file_extension method.

**Returns:** `Object` — description - a brief string description

[Docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/Importer.html#description-instance_method)

#### `do_options => Object`

This method is called by SketchUp when the user clicks on the “Options” button inside the File > Import dialog.

#### `load_file(file_path, status) => Object`

This method is called by SketchUp after the user has selected a file to import.

**Remarks:** This method is called by SketchUp after the user has selected a file to import. This is where you do the real work by opening the file via Ruby’s File object and processing it in whatever way you need. You must return an integer success code to SketchUp when you are done. These are the codes that SketchUp understands:

**Parameters:**
- `file_path` (Object) — Absolute path to the file the user selected
- `status` (Object) — The status of the import so far. Contains true.

## InputPoint (class)

The InputPoint class is used to pick 3d points and/or entities that reside under the current cursor location, similar to native Line tool and other drawing tools. Unlike PickHelper, InputPoint uses inference, i.e. “snaps” to vertices and other entities when the cursor is close to them. Only Tools react to cursor location and most of these methods are only useful in the context of a tool. For example, if you want to determine the 3d point you just moved the cursor over, you would use #pick from within your Tool#onMouseMove method. InputPoints are best picked from mouse move, as you want them to draw them to the view. For an example, see Tool Example. To lock inference similar to native SketchUp tools, see View#lock_inference.

[Vendor docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/InputPoint.html)

### Constructors
- `InputPoint(pt_or_vertex)` — Note: Prior to SketchUp 2019 it was not possible to sub-class Sketchup::InputPoint due to a bug in how SketchUp initialized the class. The new method is used to create a new InputPoint object.

**Remarks:** The degrees_of_freedom method retrieves the number of degrees of freedom there are for an input point. If you are just getting a point in space, then the degrees_of_freedom will be 3 - meaning that there is nothing about the point that would constrain its position. If you are on a face, then the degrees_of_freedom will be 2 meaning that you can only move on the plane of the face. If you are on an Edge or an axis, then the degrees_of_freedom will be 1 meaning that you can only move in the direction of the edge or axis. If you get an end point of an Edge, or an intersection point, then the degrees_of_freedom will be 0.

**Returns:** `Object` — degrees_of_freedom - see comments.

[Docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/InputPoint.html#degrees_of_freedom-instance_method)

#### `depth => Object`

#### `transformation => Object`

The transformation method retrieves the Transformation object for the input point.

**Remarks:** The transformation method retrieves the Transformation object for the input point. If the InputPoint object is getting its position from something inside of a component instance, this method returns the Transformation of the component instance. Otherwise it returns the identity Transformation. Note that the position method on a input point always returns a point that is transformed into model space. If you are using the edge, face or vertex method on the InputPoint though, you will probably need to use the transformation method to transform the data that you get back from the selected entity.

**Returns:** `Object` — transformation - the Transformation for the input point if successful

[Docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/InputPoint.html#transformation-instance_method)

The #onOpen method is called when an instance is “opened,” meaning an end user has double clicked on it to edit its geometry.

**Remarks:** The #onOpen method is called when an instance is “opened,” meaning an end user has double clicked on it to edit its geometry. This is particularly useful if your plugin is dynamically drawing geometry or performing transformations in global space, since when in “edit component” mode all transformations and positions are returned in relation to the current component’s origin. This method will tell you when a user has entered edit mode, and you can then use Model#active_path and Model#edit_transform methods to determine any corrections you need to make to your transformations.

## Layer (class)

Note: As of SketchUp 2020 “Layers” were renamed to “Tags” in the UI. The API retains the use of “Layer” for compatibility and is synonymous with “Tag”. The Layer class contains methods modifying and extracting information for a layer. By default, a SketchUp model has one layer, Layer 0 (Named “Untagged” in the UI since SketchUp 2020), which is the base layer. You can’t delete or rename Layer 0. Unlike certain other CAD software packages, entities associated with different layers in SketchUp still intersect with each other. (If you want collections of entities to not intersect, place them in Groups instead.) Layers are commonly used to organize your model and control the visibility of related groups and components. For example, you could make all of your wall and roof entities different groups, associate layers with those groups, and then hide those layers so as to display just the floor plan in the model.

[Vendor docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/Layer.html)

### Methods
#### `<=>(layer2) => Integer`

The #<=> method is used to compare two layers based on their names.

## Licensing (interface)

The Sketchup::Licensing module contains methods for extensions purchased from Extension Warehouse to check their licensing status. It is advised to place these calls inside encrypted Ruby (.rbe) files. This API is also exposed via the SketchUp C API. Extensions that already use native code should prefer using the native API, which should be more secure than their Ruby API counterparts. For more details, see Licensing Example

[Vendor docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/Licensing.html)

### Methods
#### `get_extension_license(extension_id) => Sketchup::Licensing::ExtensionLicense`

Starting in SketchUp 2025.0, this method automatically tries to fetch a license from Extension Warehouse if the extension doesn’t have a license on the current device. This only works if the user is signed in. In earlier SketchUp versions, the user has to go to Extension Manager, expand the extension in question and press Update License if the license is missing. (For performance reasons this automatic fetching is skipped during SU startup. Make sure to do a license check when the user interacts with the extension).

**Parameters:**
- `extension_id` (String) — The Extension Warehouse UUID for the desired extension.

**Returns:** `Sketchup::Licensing::ExtensionLicense` — An object representing licensing state for the extension. Do not store this object; retrieve it again when needed since licensing state may have changed.

**Remarks:** The export method is used to export a given file format. It knows which format to export based on the file extension you place on the file name. For example, a filename of “thing.obj” will export an OBJ file, whereas “thing.dae” will export a COLLADA file. For SketchUp Pro 7.1+, valid extensions include dae, kmz, 3ds, dwg, dxf, fbx, obj, wrl, and xsi. SketchUp Free only supports dae and kmz. Format Support Changes: SketchUp 7.1 added COLLADA (.dae) export capability. SketchUp Pro 2015+ added IFC export capability. SketchUp Pro 2016+ added PDF export capability. SketchUp Pro 2018+ added options for all 3D exporters. SketchUp 2024+ added glb and usdz exporters. SketchUp 2026+ the IFC exporter has been replaced with a new implementation that provides specific export options. See the Exporter Options file for information on creating a valid hash for the various exporters.

**Parameters:**
- `path` (String) — The name of the file to export.
- `show_summary` (Boolean) — Boolean to show summary dialog.

**Returns:** `Boolean` —

#### `start_operation(op_name, disable_ui = false, next_transparent = false, transparent = false) => Boolean`

Note: Operations in SketchUp are sequential and cannot be nested.

**Remarks:** Note: Operations in SketchUp are sequential and cannot be nested. If you start a new Ruby operation while another is still open, you will implicitly close the first one. The #start_operation method is used to notify SketchUp that a new operation (which can be undone) is starting. The op_name argument is a description for the operation that is displayed adjacent to the Edit > Undo menu item. Make sure to provide a user friendly name for your operation. Starting with SketchUp 7.0, there are three additional booleans that one can pass in when starting an operation. It is recommended to always set disable_ui to true. It’s left to false for default for compatibility reasons.

**Parameters:**
- `op_name` (String) — name of the operation visible in the UI
- `disable_ui` (Boolean) — if set to true, then SketchUp’s tendency to update the user interface after each geometry change will be suppressed. This can result in much faster Ruby code execution if the operation involves updating the model in any way.
- `next_transparent` (Boolean) — Deprecated! if set to true, then whatever operation comes after this one will be appended into one combined operation, allowing the user the undo both actions with a single undo command. This flag is a highly difficult one, since there are so many ways that a SketchUp user can interrupt a given operation with one of their own. Use extreme caution and test thoroughly when setting this to true.
- `transparent` (Boolean) — if set to true, then this operation will append to the previous operation. This is particularly useful for creating observers that react to user actions without littering the undo stack with extra steps that Ruby is performing.

**Returns:** `Boolean` — true if successful, false if unsuccessful

## ModelObserver (class)

This class is abstract. To implement this observer, create a Ruby class of this type, override the desired methods, and add an instance of the observer to the model. Note: Since SketchUp 2016, all observer events within a transaction are queued and fired only after the operation is committed. This means callbacks like #onTransactionStart and other model events do not fire in real-time, but are delayed until the transaction completes. The callbacks fire in the correct sequence, but they all occur at commit time, not when the operations themselves happen. This behavior change was made to improve performance and stability. Note: The API currently lacks a method to query the current operation state (e.g., whether a transaction is currently open). This limitation means observers cannot be used to monitor the real-time state of transactions. This observer interface is implemented to react to model events. Note that the observers related to transactions (aka undoable operations) are primarily for reporting and debugging. Performing any edit operations of your own (such as modifying the model) inside the observer callback should be avoided, as it could cause crashes or model corruption. The most common use for these callbacks is to help debug problems where your Ruby script’s Sketchup::Model#start_operation and Sketchup::Model#commit_operation calls are somehow conflicting with SketchUp’s native undo operations. You can set up an observer set to watch precisely what is going on.

### Methods
#### `onActivePathChanged(model) => nil`

The #onActivePathChanged method is invoked when the user opens or closes a ComponentInstance or Group for editing.

**Remarks:** The #onActivePathChanged method is invoked when the user opens or closes a ComponentInstance or Group for editing. When the user opens an instance for editing the positions and transformations of the entities in the opened instance will be relative to global world coordinates instead of the local coordinates relative to their parent. See Sketchup::Model#active_path and Sketchup::Model#edit_transform for methods that report the current edit origin vs. the global origin, etc. By using this observer callback, you can keep track of the various nested transformations as your users double click to drill into and out of component edits.

**Parameters:**
- `model` (Sketchup::Model)

**Returns:** `nil` — 

[Docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/ModelObserver.html#onActivePathChanged-instance_method)

#### `onAfterComponentSaveAs(model) => nil`

**Parameters:**
- `model` (Sketchup::Model)

**Returns:** `nil` — 

[Docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/ModelObserver.html#onAfterComponentSaveAs-instance_method)

#### `onBeforeComponentSaveAs(model) => nil`

The #onBeforeComponentSaveAs method is invoked when the user context-clicks > Save As on a component instance.

**Remarks:** The #onBeforeComponentSaveAs method is invoked when the user context-clicks > Save As on a component instance. It is called just before the component is written to disk, so you can make changes within the handler and it will make it into the save. For example, you may decide that you want to add some attribute to every component that is saved out, but you do not want that attribute sticking around inside the current model. Within #onBeforeComponentSaveAs you could add the attribute, and within #onAfterComponentSaveAs you could delete that attribute. The callback is not sent the component that is to be saved, but the model’s selection will contain it.

**Parameters:**
- `model` (Sketchup::Model)

**Returns:** `nil` — 

[Docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/ModelObserver.html#onBeforeComponentSaveAs-instance_method)

#### `onDeleteModel(model) => nil`

Deprecated.

**Remarks:** Deprecated. This callback is deprecated. To handle model close events, use AppObserver#onCloseModel instead. The #onDeleteModel method is invoked when a model is deleted.

**Parameters:**
- `model` (Sketchup::Model)

**Returns:** `nil` — 

[Docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/ModelObserver.html#onDeleteModel-instance_method)

#### `onEraseAll(model) => nil`

Deprecated.

**Remarks:** Deprecated. This callback is deprecated. To handle model close events, use AppObserver#onCloseModel instead. The #onEraseAll method is invoked when everything in a model is erased.

**Parameters:**
- `model` (Sketchup::Model)

**Returns:** `nil` — 

[Docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/ModelObserver.html#onEraseAll-instance_method)

#### `onExplode(model) => nil`

The method is invoked whenever a component anywhere in this model is exploded.

**Remarks:** The method is invoked whenever a component anywhere in this model is exploded. This is an easier way to watch explode events vs. attaching an InstanceObserver to every instance in the model. Since the callback does not return what was exploded, one solution is to place a selection observer that keeps track of which entities whose explosion you are interested in are in the selection. Since SketchUp’s user interface only provides a means of exploding the selection, this method is a reliable way to know what was just exploded. Another method would be to watch ComponentDefinition.count_instances to determine what just changed, as any components that were exploded will now be less an instance.

**Parameters:**
- `model` (Sketchup::Model)

**Returns:** `nil` — 

[Docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/ModelObserver.html#onExplode-instance_method)

#### `onPidChanged(model, old_pid, new_pid) => nil`

Note: This callback is useful for tracking changes to entities that result in new PIDs, such as grouping or other modifications that result in new entities.

**Remarks:** Note: This callback is useful for tracking changes to entities that result in new PIDs, such as grouping or other modifications that result in new entities. The #onPidChanged method is invoked when a persistent id of an entity changes within the model.

**Parameters:**
- `model` (Sketchup::Model)
- `old_pid` (Integer) — The old persistent ID of the entity.
- `new_pid` (Integer) — The new persistent ID of the entity.

**Returns:** `nil` — 

[Docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/ModelObserver.html#onPidChanged-instance_method)

#### `onPlaceComponent(model) => nil`

The #onPlaceComponent method is invoked when a component is “placed” into the model, meaning it is dragged from the Component Browser.

**Remarks:** The #onPlaceComponent method is invoked when a component is “placed” into the model, meaning it is dragged from the Component Browser.

**Parameters:**
- `model` (Sketchup::Model)

**Returns:** `nil` — 

[Docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/ModelObserver.html#onTransactionAbort-instance_method)

#### `onTransactionCommit(model) => nil`

The #onTransactionCommit method is invoked when a transaction containing model changes is completed.

**Remarks:** The #onTransactionCommit method is invoked when a transaction containing model changes is completed. This callback is only triggered for transactions that actually modified the model. If a transaction is committed without any model changes, #onTransactionEmpty will be called instead of this method. This is important to understand when implementing transaction event handlers.

**Parameters:**
- `model` (Sketchup::Model)

**Returns:** `nil` — 

[Docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/ModelObserver.html#onTransactionCommit-instance_method)

#### `onTransactionEmpty(model) => nil`

**Remarks:** The #onTransactionEmpty method is invoked when a transaction (aka an undoable operation) starts and then is committed without anything being altered in between. This callback is triggered instead of #onTransactionCommit when a transaction contains no model changes. This behavior is important to understand when implementing handlers for transaction events. If you need a unified handler for all committed transactions (both empty and non-empty), you’ll need to implement both callbacks.

#### `onTransactionStart(model) => nil`

Note: This callback is not fired immediately when Sketchup::Model#start_operation is called.

**Remarks:** Note: This callback is not fired immediately when Sketchup::Model#start_operation is called. Instead, it is queued and triggered when the transaction is committed, firing just before #onTransactionCommit or #onTransactionEmpty. Since SketchUp 2016, all transaction-related events are queued and fired at commit time in the appropriate sequence, rather than in real-time when the operations occur. The #onTransactionStart method is invoked when a transaction (aka an undoable operation) starts.

**Parameters:**
- `model` (Sketchup::Model)

**Returns:** `nil` — 

[Docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/ModelObserver.html#onTransactionStart-instance_method)

## OptionsProviderObserver (class)

This class is abstract. To implement this observer, create a Ruby class of this type, override the desired methods, and add an instance of the observer to the objects of interests. This observer interface is implemented to react to operations provider events. What this means is that you can watch as the user changes SketchUp options and react to them. The following OptionsProviders are defined in the API: "UnitsOptions" "PrintOptions" "PageOptions" "SlideshowOptions" Each of these has a list of specific options that the user can set. See the OptionsManager and OptionsProvider classes for more details.

[Vendor docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/OptionsProviderObserver.html)

### Methods

[Docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/OptionsProviderObserver.html#onOptionsProviderChanged-instance_method)

## Overlay (class)

An Overlay provides contextual model information directly in the viewport. This can be presented in 2D and 3D. Examples can be annotations or analytical model information such as geometry analysis, energy analysis, etc. The overlay feature is not intended as a mechanism to provide custom entities to SketchUp. Whatever overlays draw is not pickable nor exportable. It is also not allowed to perform model changes from overlay events. Doing so will result in a RuntimeError being thrown.

[Vendor docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/Overlay.html)

### Constructors
- `Overlay(id, name, description: "")` — 

### Methods
#### `draw(view) => Object`

This method is abstract.

**Remarks:** This method is abstract. It is called whenever the view updates. Note: This is called very often. Perform minimal amount of computation in this event. Cache the data needed to draw what the overlay needs whenever possible. Note: If you draw outside the model bounds you need to implement #getExtents which return a bounding box large enough to include the points you draw. Otherwise your drawing will be clipped.

**Parameters:**
- `view` (Sketchup::View) — A View object where the method was invoked.

[Docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/Overlay.html#draw-instance_method)

#### `enabled? => Boolean`



**Returns:** `Boolean` — 

[Docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/Overlay.html#enabled?-instance_method)

#### `getExtents => Geom::BoundingBox`

This method is abstract.

**Remarks:** This method is abstract. The method should be implementing sub-classes ensure what is drawn in 3D space doesn’t appear clipped. If the overlay only draws in 2D this isn’t needed. Note: This is called very often. Perform minimal amount of computation in this event. Cache the data needed to compute the bounds of what the overlay draws whenever possible. In order to accurately draw things, SketchUp needs to know the extents of what it is drawing. If the overlay is doing its own drawing, it may need to implement this method to tell SketchUp the extents of what it will be drawing. If you don’t implement this method, you may find that part of what the overlay is drawing gets clipped to the extents of the rest of the model. This must return a Geom::BoundingBox. In a typical implementation, you will create a new Geom::BoundingBox, add points to set the extents of the drawing that the overlay will do and then return it.

**Returns:** `Geom::BoundingBox` — 

[Docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/Overlay.html#getExtents-instance_method)

#### `name => String`

## PickHelper (class)

Note: The same Pickhelper instance is being reused by SketchUp. Don’t extend, add methods or redefine methods on this object as it can clash with other extensions. The PickHelper class is used to pick entities that reside under the current cursor location, similar to native Select tool. Unlike InputPoint, PickHelper uses no inference. Only Tools react to cursor location and most of these methods are only useful in the context of a tool. For example, if you want to determine the entity you just clicked, you would use #do_pick from within your Tool#onLButtonDown method. You can retrieve a PickHelper object using the View#pick_helper method. Entities that are picked (found under the cursor when a mouse or keyboard event occurs), are called Pick Records and are placed in an indexed list.

[Vendor docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/PickHelper.html)

### Methods
#### `all_picked => Object`

The all_picked method is used to get an array of entities from the active entities from all the pick paths.

**Remarks:** The all_picked method is used to get an array of entities from the active entities from all the pick paths. Duplicates might occur if there are multiple pick paths for entities that ends in a group or component. For example, if the pick hits at the border of an edge and face inside a group there will be two pick paths - one for the face and one for the edge. Since this method returns entities from the active entities it would return an array with the group two times.

**Returns:** `Object` — elements - the array of elements in the pick.

[Docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/PickHelper.html#all_picked-instance_method)

#### `best_picked => Object`

Note: The return value will be a negative index when a segment is picked.

**Remarks:** Note: The return value will be a negative index when a segment is picked. The #pick_segment method is used to pick a segment of a polyline curve that is defined by an array of points. If you click on a point in a polyline curve, the index of the point in the curve is returned (starting at 0). If you click on a segment in the polyline curve, the index of the segment is returned. Segments are returned by negative indicies and start at index -1 (for the segment connecting the first two points) and increase by a factor of -1 (for example, the segment connecting second and third point is -2).

## Procedure (class)

This class is abstract. Implement the methods described in this class to create a procedure. Your subclass must call super from its #initialize, passing in the necessary arguments. To create a new procedure in Ruby, you must define a new class that implements its methods. Register the instance of your procedure class via register_procedure. Example:

[Vendor docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/Procedure.html)

### Constructors
- `Procedure(id:, description:, version:)` — All arguments are required.

### Methods
#### `declare_params_and_ui(args) => String`

This method is abstract.

**Remarks:** This method is abstract. Called by SketchUp to get the parameter and UI declaration for this procedure. Returns A JSON string describing the parameters and UI. The keys in the JSON object are parameter identifiers (e.g., “count”, “spacing”) that match the parameter keys used when calling ComponentDefinition#attach_procedure. Each parameter identifier maps to an object containing UI widget specifications. See the Declarative UI Schema file for the full widget schema.

**Parameters:**
- `args` (Hash{Symbol => Object}) — Hash containing the method parameters.

**Returns:** `String` — A JSON string describing the parameters and UI. The keys in the JSON object are parameter identifiers (e.g., “count”, “spacing”) that match the parameter keys used when calling ComponentDefinition#attach_procedure. Each parameter identifier maps to an object containing UI widget specifications. See the Declarative UI Schema file for the full widget schema.

[Docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/Procedure.html#declare_params_and_ui-instance_method)

#### `draw(args) => nil`

This method is abstract.

**Remarks:** This method is abstract. (Optional) Called once per view refresh while the procedural component is open for editing, allowing the procedure to draw custom feedback into the view. Note: Since this method is called during drawing, it should run as fast as possible. Avoid slow computations and prefer simplified representations of the final geometry when possible.

**Parameters:**
- `args` (Hash{Symbol => Object}) — Hash containing the method parameters.

**Returns:** `nil` — 

[Docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/Procedure.html#draw-instance_method)

#### `get_extents(args) => Geom::BoundingBox`

This method is abstract.

**Remarks:** This method is abstract. (Optional) Called while the procedural component is open for editing to get the bounds of what #draw renders. Implement this if the preview can extend beyond the bounds of the component, which could otherwise leave it clipped out of the view. Note: Since this method is called during drawing, it should run as fast as possible. It is strictly observational and it must not draw or modify the model. Returns The bounds of the preview drawn by #draw. An empty bounding box means the preview needs no extra room.

**Parameters:**
- `args` (Hash{Symbol => Object}) — Hash containing the method parameters.

**Returns:** `Geom::BoundingBox` — The bounds of the preview drawn by #draw. An empty bounding box means the preview needs no extra room.

[Docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/Procedure.html#get_extents-instance_method)

#### `get_widget_states(args) => Hash{String => Hash}`

This method is abstract.

**Remarks:** This method is abstract. Called by SketchUp after the procedure UI is populated and after every parameter change to determine the enabled/visible state of each widget. A procedure does not need to implement this method if the widget states do not change. Returns A hash mapping widget IDs to their desired states. Each state hash may contain :enabled and/or :visible boolean keys. Widget IDs not present in the returned hash keep their current state. See the Declarative UI Schema file for details on dynamic widget states.

**Parameters:**
- `args` (Hash{Symbol => Object}) — Hash containing the method parameters.

**Returns:** `Hash{String => Hash}` — A hash mapping widget IDs to their desired states. Each state hash may contain :enabled and/or :visible boolean keys. Widget IDs not present in the returned hash keep their current state. See the Declarative UI Schema file for details on dynamic widget states.

[Docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/Procedure.html#get_widget_states-instance_method)

#### `on_button_clicked(args) => Symbol?`

This method is abstract.

**Remarks:** This method is abstract. (Optional) Called when the user clicks a button widget declared in this procedure’s UI (a widget with “widgetType”: “button”). The procedure may perform arbitrary work against the model in response. A procedure does not need to implement this method if it does not declare any buttons. Note: If the handler modifies the model it should wrap the changes in its own operation using Model#start_operation and Model#commit_operation. Return :reload_ui to request a full rebuild of the procedure’s UI (for example when the handler changed parameter values that the widgets need to reflect). Return nil or any other value to leave the existing widgets in place.

**Parameters:**
- `args` (Hash{Symbol => Object}) — Hash containing the method parameters.

**Returns:** `Symbol, nil` — Return :reload_ui to request a full rebuild of the procedure’s UI (for example when the handler changed parameter values that the widgets need to reflect). Return nil or any other value to leave the existing widgets in place.

[Docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/Procedure.html#on_button_clicked-instance_method)

#### `on_open_close(args) => nil`

This method is abstract.

**Remarks:** This method is abstract. (Optional) Called when this procedure’s component is opened or closed for editing. The :action argument distinguishes the two. This can be useful if the procedure needs to activate a custom tool when its component is opened, for instance. Note: This method is strictly observational. Do not modify the model from within it and do not call Model#start_operation / Model#commit_operation. It can be called while undoing or redoing an open/close and always runs inside the open/close operation.

**Parameters:**
- `args` (Hash{Symbol => Object}) — Hash containing the method parameters.

**Returns:** `nil` — 

[Docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/Procedure.html#on_open_close-instance_method)

#### `run(args) => Boolean, Array<Hash>`

This method is abstract.

**Remarks:** This method is abstract. Called by SketchUp to execute the procedure. You should first clear the output entities. Then validate the control geometry and parameters (you can call your own #validate method for this). If the input is invalid, return errors as appropriate. And finally generate the output geometry. This method will be called with an operation already started by the framework. Do not explicitly call Model#start_operation and Model#commit_operation from within this code.

**Parameters:**
- `args` (Hash{Symbol => Object}) — Hash containing the method parameters.

**Returns:** `Boolean, Array<Hash>` — true on success, false on failure. Optionally, return an Array of error hashes to report specific errors. Each error hash may contain: :title [String] A short title for the error. :description [String] Description of the error. :involved_entities [+Array<Integer>+] (optional) Persistent IDs (Entity#persistent_id) of the entities to be highlighted.

[Docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/Procedure.html#run-instance_method)

[Docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/TextureWriter.html#write_all-instance_method)

## Tool (class)

This class is abstract. Implement the methods described in this class to create a tool. You can not sub-class this class because it is not defined by the API. Tool is the interface that you implement to create a SketchUp tool. See our code example for how to create a custom tool in Ruby. To create a new tool in Ruby, you must define a new class that implements the methods for the events that you want to respond to. You do not have to implement methods for every possible event that a Tool can respond to. Once you have defined a tool class, you select that tool by creating an instance of it and passing it to Model#select_tool. For example: The following table contains several constants you can use when checking for modifier key presses and releases inside the keyboard handling callbacks: CONSTRAIN_MODIFIER_KEY = Shift Key COPY_MODIFIER_KEY = Alt/Option on Mac, Ctrl on PC ALT_MODIFIER_KEY = Command on Mac, Alt on PC The following table contains several constants you can use when checking for modifier keys that are active inside keyboard and mouse handling callbacks. These values are available via the flags parameter of the callbacks: CONSTRAIN_MODIFIER_MASK = Shift Key COPY_MODIFIER_MASK = Alt/Option on Mac, Ctrl on PC ALT_MODIFIER_MASK = Command on Mac, Alt on PC

[Vendor docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/Tool.html)

### Methods
#### `activate => Object`

The #activate method is called by SketchUp when the tool is selected.

**Remarks:** The #activate method is called by SketchUp when the tool is selected. It is a good place to put most of your initialization, such as instance variables to track the state of the tool.

[Docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/Tool.html#activate-instance_method)

#### `deactivate(view) => Object`

The #deactivate method is called when the tool is deactivated because a different tool was selected.

**Remarks:** The #deactivate method is called when the tool is deactivated because a different tool was selected.

**Parameters:**
- `view` (Sketchup::View)

[Docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/Tool.html#deactivate-instance_method)

#### `draw(view) => Object`

Note: If you draw outside the model bounds you need to implement #getExtents which return a bounding box large enough to include the points you draw.

**Remarks:** Note: If you draw outside the model bounds you need to implement #getExtents which return a bounding box large enough to include the points you draw. Otherwise your drawing will be clipped. The #draw method is called by SketchUp whenever the view is refreshed to allow the tool to do its own drawing. If the tool has some temporary graphics that it wants displayed while it is active, it should implement this method and draw to the View.

**Parameters:**
- `view` (Sketchup::View) — A View object where the method was invoked.

[Docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/Tool.html#draw-instance_method)

#### `enableVCB? => Boolean`

The #enableVCB? method is used to tell SketchUp whether to allow the user to enter text into the VCB (value control box, aka the “measurements” panel).

**Remarks:** The #enableVCB? method is used to tell SketchUp whether to allow the user to enter text into the VCB (value control box, aka the “measurements” panel). If you do not implement this method, then the vcb is disabled by default.

**Returns:** `Boolean` — Return true if you want the VCB enabled

[Docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/Tool.html#enableVCB?-instance_method)

#### `getExtents => Geom::BoundingBox`

In order to accurately draw things, SketchUp needs to know the extents of what it is drawing.

**Remarks:** In order to accurately draw things, SketchUp needs to know the extents of what it is drawing. If the tool is doing its own drawing, it may need to implement this method to tell SketchUp the extents of what it will be drawing. If you don’t implement this method, you may find that part of what the tool is drawing gets clipped to the extents of the rest of the model.

**Returns:** `Geom::BoundingBox` — 

[Docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/Tool.html#getExtents-instance_method)

#### `getInstructorContentDirectory => String`

Note: Prior to SketchUp 2014 this method would assume the path was relative to the SketchUp resource folder.

**Remarks:** Note: Prior to SketchUp 2014 this method would assume the path was relative to the SketchUp resource folder. From 2014 and onwards you can specify the absolute path to an HTML file or the absolute path to a directory containing an index.html file. The #getInstructorContentDirectory method is used to tell SketchUp the directory containing your Tool’s instructor content. To use this, create a custom instructor directory, put an index.html file inside of it, and then return that path via this method. If the SketchUp user has the Instructor window open when they activate your tool, they will see your html file.

**Returns:** `String` — the directory path where the Instructor content exists.

[Docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/Tool.html#getInstructorContentDirectory-instance_method)

#### `getMenu(menu) => nil | getMenu(menu, flags, x, y, view) => nil | getMenu(menu, flags, x, y, view) => nil`

Note: In SketchUp 2015 the flags, x, y and view parameters were added.

**Remarks:** Note: In SketchUp 2015 the flags, x, y and view parameters were added. They are needed if you need to pick the entities under the mouse position. The new parameters are optional, but if you need to use one you must include them all. The #getMenu method is called by SketchUp to let the tool provide its own context menu. Most tools will not want to implement this method and, instead, use the normal context menu found on all entities. If you do implement this method, the argument is a Menu. You should use the Menu#add_item method to build the context menu. Your tool will use a standard context menu by default if you do not implement this method. Implement this method if you want a context-click to display something other than this default context menu.

**Parameters:**
- `menu` (Sketchup::Menu)

**Returns:** `nil` — 

[Docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/Tool.html#getMenu-instance_method)

#### `onCancel(reason, view) => Object`

Note: When something is undone #onCancel is called before the undo is actually executed.

**Remarks:** Note: When something is undone #onCancel is called before the undo is actually executed. If you need to do something with the model after an undo use ModelObserver#onTransactionUndo. Note: When #onKeyDown is implemented and returns true, pressing Esc doesn’t trigger #onCancel. The #onCancel method is called by SketchUp to cancel the current operation of the tool. The typical response will be to reset the tool to its initial state. The reason identifies the action that triggered the call. The reason can be one of the following values: 0: the user canceled the current operation by hitting the escape key. 1: the user re-selected the same tool from the toolbar or menu. 2: the user did an undo while the tool was active.

**Parameters:**
- `reason` (Integer) — A reason value (see comments).
- `view` (Sketchup::View)

[Docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/Tool.html#onCancel-instance_method)

#### `onKeyDown(key, repeat, flags, view) => Boolean`

The #onKeyDown method is called by SketchUp when the user presses a key on the keyboard.

**Remarks:** The #onKeyDown method is called by SketchUp when the user presses a key on the keyboard. If you want to get input from the VCB, you should implement onUserText rather than this method. This method is can be used for special keys such as the Shift key, Ctrl key, and so on, or for just determining which key a user pressed. This method is actually called for all keys that are pressed. There are several “virtual keys” defined as constants you can use. Their use is cross platform. They are: VK_ALT VK_COMMAND VK_CONTROL VK_DELETE VK_DOWN VK_END VK_HOME VK_INSERT VK_LEFT VK_MENU VK_NEXT VK_PRIOR VK_RIGHT VK_SHIFT VK_SPACE VK_UP V6: There is a bug on Windows where the typematic effect does not work. Typematic effects work fine on a Mac.

[Vendor docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/ToolsObserver.html)

### Methods
#### `onActiveToolChanged(tools, tool_name, tool_id) => nil`

Note: In SketchUp 6 and SketchUp 7.

**Remarks:** Note: In SketchUp 6 and SketchUp 7.0, tool names on the Mac have some of their first characters truncated. For instance, on Windows, a tool is “CameraOrbit”. On the Mac, is comes across as “raOrbit”. Therefore, use the tool_id to keep track of which tool you need to watch for, or use logic that corrects for the error. There is an example method of one way to do this shown below. (This example is not a comprehensive list of the tool names.) Once you subclass Sketchup::ToolsObserver with your unique class, you can override the #onActiveToolChanged method to receive tool change notifications.

**Parameters:**
- `tools` (Sketchup::Tools) — A Tools object.
- `tool_name` (String) — The name of the tool.
- `tool_id` (Integer) — The ID of the tool. This is a predefined number unique to a given tool. For example, the Materials Browser is tool_id 21074.

**Returns:** `nil` — 

[Docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/ToolsObserver.html#onActiveToolChanged-instance_method)

#### `onToolStateChanged(tools, tool_name, tool_id, tool_state) => nil`

Note: Behavior changed in SketchUp 2016.

**Remarks:** Note: Behavior changed in SketchUp 2016. Tool state changes are queued and may be delivered after the tool operation has completed. Multiple state changes can be coalesced and some tools may never trigger this callback. The tool_state value is an internal integer that is not standardized across tools and often remains 0. Do not rely on specific numeric values. Prefer #onActiveToolChanged for reliable notifications of active tool changes, or tool-specific observers when available. Note: In SketchUp 6 and SketchUp 7, tool names on the Mac had their first few characters truncated. For instance, on Windows a tool name was “CameraOrbit”, while on the Mac it came across as “raOrbit”. This bug was fixed in SketchUp 8.0. Use tool_id if you need a stable identifier. The #onToolStateChanged method is invoked when a tool reports a state transition.

**Parameters:**
- `tools` (Sketchup::Tools) — A Tools object.
- `tool_name` (String) — The name of the tool.
- `tool_id` (Integer) — The ID of the tool. This is a predefined number unique to a given tool. For example, the Materials Browser is tool_id 21074.
- `tool_state` (Integer) — A tool-specific state code. Not standardized and often 0 in modern releases.

**Returns:** `nil` —

Note: If you draw outside the model bounds you need to implement Tool#getExtents which returns a bounding box large enough to include the points you draw.

**Remarks:** Note: If you draw outside the model bounds you need to implement Tool#getExtents which returns a bounding box large enough to include the points you draw. Otherwise your drawing will be clipped. The #draw method is used to do basic drawing. This method can only be called from within the Tool#draw method of a tool that you implement in Ruby. The following constants are all OpenGL terms and have been externalized to Ruby. Here is a summary of their meanings: GL_POINTS Treats each vertex as a single point. Vertex n defines point n. N points are drawn. GL_LINES Treats each pair of vertices as an independent line segment. Vertices 2n-1 and 2n define line n. N/2 lines are drawn. GL_LINE_STRIP Draws a connected group of line segments from the first vertex to the last. Vertices n and n+1 define line n. N-1 lines are drawn. GL_LINE_LOOP Draws a connected group of line segments from the first vertex to the last, then back to the first. Vertices n and n+1 define line n. The last line, however, is defined by vertices N and 1. N lines are drawn. GL_TRIANGLES Treats each triplet of vertices as an independent triangle. Vertices 3n-2, 3n-1, and 3n define triangle n. N/3 triangles are drawn. GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP Draws a connected group of triangles. One triangle is defined for each vertex presented after the first two vertices. For odd n, vertices n, n+1, and n+2 define triangle n. For even n, vertices n+1, n, and n+2 define triangle n. N-2 triangles are drawn. GL_TRIANGLE_FAN Draws a connected group of triangles. One triangle is defined for each vertex presented after the first two vertices. Vertices 1, n+1, and n+2 define triangle n. N-2 triangles are drawn. GL_QUADS Treats each group of four vertices as an independent quadrilateral. Vertices 4n-3, 4n-2, 4n-1, and 4n define quadrilateral n. N/4 quadrilaterals are drawn. GL_QUAD_STRIP Draws a connected group of quadrilaterals. One quadrilateral is defined for each pair of vertices presented after the first pair. Vertices 2n-1, 2n, 2n+2, and 2n+1 define quadrilateral n. N/2-1 quadrilaterals are drawn. Note that the order in which vertices are used to construct a quadrilateral from strip data is different from that used with independent data. GL_POLYGON Draws a single, convex polygon. Vertices 1 through N define this polygon.

**Parameters:**
- `openglenum` (Integer) — The item you are going to draw, one of the constants from the comments, such as GL_LINES.
- `points` (Array<Geom::Point3d>)

Note: Prior to SketchUp 2025.

**Remarks:** Note: Prior to SketchUp 2025.0 this method accepted the points as physical screen coordinates. As of SketchUp 2025.0 the points are expected to be in logical screen coordinates. Older versions need to apply the scaling factor from UI.scale_factor to the points before passing them to this method. The #draw2d method is used to draw in screen space (using 2D screen coordinates) instead of 3D space. The second parameter is an Array of Geom::Point3d objects (or several individual Geom::Point3d objects). These Geom::Point3d objects are in screen space, not 3D space. The X value corresponds to the number of pixels from the left edge of the drawing area. The Y value corresponds to the number of pixels down from the top of the drawing area. The Z value is not used.

**Parameters:**
- `openglenum` (Integer) — The item you are going to draw, one of the constants from the comments, such as GL_LINES.

#### `draw_points(points, size = 6, style = 3, color = 'black') => Sketchup::View`

Note: Prior to SketchUp 2025.

**Remarks:** Note: Prior to SketchUp 2025.0 this method accepted the size as physical pixels. As of SketchUp 2025.0 the points are expected to be in logical pixels. Older versions need to apply the scaling factor from UI.scale_factor to the size before passing them to this method. This method is used to draw points in model space.

**Parameters:**
- `points` (Array<Geom::Point3d>) — Model coordinates.
- `size` (Integer) — Size of the point in pixels.

#### `draw_text(point, text) => Sketchup::View | draw_text(point, text, options = {}) => Sketchup::View`

Note: Under Windows the font name must be less than 32 characters - due to system limitations.

**Remarks:** Note: Under Windows the font name must be less than 32 characters - due to system limitations. Note: As of SU2017 this will automatically scale the font-size by the same factor as UI.scale_factor. Note: The font size is platform dependent. On Windows the method expects points, where on Mac it’s pixels. See “Cross Platform Font Size” example for details. As of SketchUp 2025.0 you can use the :pixel_size or :point_size options to specify the size in pixels or points respectively. This method is used to draw text on the screen and is usually invoked within the draw method of a tool. The TextVerticalAlignCenter option will align the text to the center of the height of the first line, not the whole boundingbox of the text. To align around the full bounds of the text, use #text_bounds to compute the desired alignment. The vertical alignment can vary between fonts and platforms. It’s recommended to test different fonts and find one that fits well across both platforms for your purposes. Example of different vertical alignment and text bounds:

**Parameters:**
- `point` (Geom::Point3d) — A Point3d object representing a 2D coordinate in view space.
- `text` (String) — The text string to draw.

#### `load_texture(image_rep) => Integer`

Note: Avoid loading and releasing textures within the Tool#draw event as that is not efficient.

**Remarks:** Note: Avoid loading and releasing textures within the Tool#draw event as that is not efficient. Note: SketchUp 2020.0-2022.0: To conserve resources on the user’s machine, textures can be loaded only when there is a Ruby tool on the tool stack. Make sure to release the texture when it’s no longer needed. Any textures not already released when the last Ruby tool on the tool stack is removed will be automatically released by SketchUp. As of SketchUp 2023.0 this automatic cleanup was removed to allow Overlays to draw textures. Loads a texture to be drawn with #draw or #draw2d.

**Parameters:**
- `image_rep` (Sketchup::ImageRep)

**Returns:** `Integer` — A resource ID referring to the image loaded.

**Returns:** `Sketchup::View` — the refreshed View object

[Docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/View.html#refresh-instance_method)

#### `release_texture(texture_id) => Boolean`

Releases a texture loaded via #load_texture, freeing up it’s memory.

**Remarks:** Releases a texture loaded via #load_texture, freeing up it’s memory. It’s good practice to do so whenever there is no longer any need for the resource. For example, when your tool deactivates you probably want to release your resources as you don’t know if your tool will be used again.

**Parameters:**
- `texture_id` (Integer)

**Returns:** `Boolean` — true if texture was released. false otherwise.

[Docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/View.html#release_texture-instance_method)

[Docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/View.html#remove_observer-instance_method)

#### `screen_coords(model_point) => Geom::Point3d | screen_coords(model_point) => Geom::Point3d`

Note: This method will return nil if the point cannot be projected to the screen.

**Remarks:** Note: This method will return nil if the point cannot be projected to the screen. This is most notably the case for the camera’s eye position itself. Note: Prior to SketchUp 2025.0 this method returned the points as physical screen coordinates. As of SketchUp 2025.0 the points are returned in logical screen coordinates. The #screen_coords method is used to retrieve the screen coordinates of the given point on the screen. The x and y values returned correspond to the x and y screen coordinates. Ignore the z values. If the referenced point is not in the current viewport, the x and/or y value may be negative.

**Parameters:**
- `model_point` (Geom::Point3d, Sketchup::Vertex) — Model coordinate.

**Returns:** `Geom::Point3d` — Screen coordinate in pixels (physical prior to SketchUp 2025.0, logical from 2025.0).

#### `set_color_from_line(point1, point2) => Sketchup::View | set_color_from_line(point1, point2, color) => Sketchup::View | set_color_from_line(inputpoint1, inputpoint2) => Sketchup::View`

Note: Uses only the active axis inference to set the color (red/green/blue).

**Remarks:** Note: Uses only the active axis inference to set the color (red/green/blue). Does not support advanced inference coloring (like parallel/perpendicular) and does not trigger visual highlighting of other geometry. Set the drawing color for the view based on the direction of a line that you want to draw. These colors will match the primary model axis colors in the SketchUp model (red, green, blue for the respective axes). This method is usually invoked within the draw method of a tool. When two InputPoint objects are passed instead of plain Geom::Point3d objects, the method uses only the active axis inference to set the drawing color (red/green/blue for axes). It does not support advanced inference coloring (like magenta for perpendicular or cyan for parallel) and does not trigger visual highlighting of other geometry. Passing plain Geom::Point3d objects also derives an axis-based color unless you override it with the optional color argument.

**Parameters:**
- `point1` (Geom::Point3d)
- `point2` (Geom::Point3d)

**Returns:** `Sketchup::View` — self

[Docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/View.html#set_color_from_line-instance_method)

#### `show_frame(delay) => Sketchup::View`

The show_frame method is used to show a frame of an Animation object in the current view.

**Remarks:** The show_frame method is used to show a frame of an Animation object in the current view. You can supply an optional delay in seconds to wait before showing the next frame. This can be useful to control the speed at which the animation runs.

**Parameters:**
- `delay` (Numeric) — An optional delay in seconds.

**Returns:** `Sketchup::View` — 

[Docs](https://ruby.sketchup.com/Sketchup/View.html#show_frame-instance_method)

#### `text_bounds(point, text, options = {}) => Geom::Bounds2d`

Note: Under Windows the font name must be less than 32 characters - due to system limitations.

**Remarks:** Note: Under Windows the font name must be less than 32 characters - due to system limitations. This method is used to compute the bounds of the text when using #draw_text. The bounds are not a tight fit around the top and bottom as they include varying amount of line spacing depending on the font used. The TextVerticalAlignCenter option will align the text to the center of the height of the first line, not the whole boundingbox of the text. Example of different vertical alignment and text bounds:

**Parameters:**
- `point` (Geom::Point3d) — A Point3d object representing a 2D coordinate in view space.
- `text` (String) — The text string to draw.
