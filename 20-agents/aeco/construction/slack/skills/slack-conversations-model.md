# Slack conversations model

Slack collapsed channels, private groups, DMs, and group-DMs into one **`conversations.*`** API. The legacy `channels.*` / `groups.*` / `im.*` / `mpim.*` families are deprecated — use `conversations.*` for everything. (The reflected catalog may still list legacy names; prefer the `conversations-*` commands.)

## Conversation IDs — and why the prefix does NOT tell you privacy

A conversation ID starts with `C`, `G`, or `D`. It is tempting to read the type off that letter — **don't.** Slack states the **prefix is an unreliable indicator of privacy**: a private channel keeps its `C…` ID (e.g. when a shared private channel is unshared, the `C…` ID does *not* revert to `G…`), so `C…` is **not** "public only."

| Prefix | Rough hint (not authoritative) |
|---|---|
| `C…` | a channel — **public or private** |
| `G…` | legacy private channel / multi-person DM (mpim) |
| `D…` | 1:1 direct message (im) |

**The authoritative type comes from booleans, not the prefix.** Call `conversations.info` and read `is_private`, `is_mpim`, `is_im`; treat the ID itself as opaque. When *listing*, pass the `types` filter (`public_channel,private_channel,mpim,im`) to scope what comes back.

You almost always need the **ID**, not the `#name`. Resolve names → IDs with `conversations.list` (and cache the mapping; see [slack-rate-limits-and-pagination](./slack-rate-limits-and-pagination.md) — `conversations.list` is paginated and rate-limited, so resolve once per run).

## The verbs you'll actually use

- `conversations.list` — enumerate channels. **Pass `types`** (`public_channel,private_channel`) or you get only public. Cursor-paginated.
- `conversations.info` — metadata for one conversation.
- `conversations.history` — messages in a channel (needs `*:history` scope).
- `conversations.replies` — messages in a **thread** (pass the parent `ts`).
- `conversations.members` — who's in it.
- `conversations.create` — make a channel (`is_private` for private). This is the **non-admin** way to create a project channel — not `admin.conversations.create` (Enterprise-Grid only; see [slack-auth-and-scopes](./slack-auth-and-scopes.md)).
- `conversations.invite` / `conversations.join` — add users / the bot.

## Posting requires membership — except public channels

- **Public channel:** with the `chat:write.public` scope the bot can post **without joining**. Otherwise `conversations.join` first.
- **Private channel:** the bot must be a **member** — invite it (`conversations.invite`) once; there is no "post to private without joining."
- **DM a user:** pass the `U…` user ID **directly** as `chat.postMessage`'s `channel` — Slack opens the 1:1 DM if it isn't already (no explicit open needed). `conversations.open` (with `users: ["U0123"]` → returns a `D…` ID) is the explicit form, and is what you need for **group DMs** (multiple users) or when you want the `D…` ID up front. Direct DMs may require the `im:write` scope.

## Common gotcha

`channel_not_found` usually means the bot isn't in a *private* channel (or you passed a `#name` instead of a conversation ID), **not** that the channel is missing. Check membership before assuming the ID is wrong.
